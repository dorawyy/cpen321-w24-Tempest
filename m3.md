### **3.3. Functional Requirements**
<a name="fr1"></a>

1. **Users can create an account with localization information to be notified of extreme weather nearby** 
    - **Overview**:
        1. Users can create an account and authenticate with known platforms like Google and Facebook
        2. Users can toggle between different weather layers on the map to display different weather visualizations
        3. Authenticated Users can enable notifications for extreme weather in their area
        4. Authenticated Users can comment on extreme weather pings to add additional information
        5. Users can enable "predictive weather" which shows where the weather event is likely to go
        6. Admins can remove comments

    
    - **Detailed Flow for Each Independent Scenario**: 
        1. **[Account Creation and Authentication]**:
            - **Description**: Users can use Facebook or Google to authenticate and create an accoun
            - **Primary actor(s)**: Users
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. Users click on the "Login" button
                2. Users choose to authenticate with either Facebook or Google
                3. Users login with the respective service
                4. Users are redirected to the account page where they can enter a nickname for anonymity
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 2a. ...
                    - 2a1. ...
                    - 2a2. ...

            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. Users selects which layer to toggle
                2. Map removes the previous visible layer, and displays the new selected animation on the screen.
            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                - 2a.
        3. **[Authenticated Users can enable notifications for extreme weather in their area]**:
            - **Description**: Authenticated Users can go into their accound and enable push notifications. They will need to accpet to share their location information if they have not already.
            - **Primary actor(s)**: Authenticated Users
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. User clicks on "enable local weather notifications" in their account

            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                 - 2a. Users decline to enable location services
                    - 6a1. A pop-up tells users location services are required to enable push notifications
                    - 6a2. Steps 7 and 8 are skipped.
                    - 6a3. A button to enable location services is now present in the Account page
                - 4a. Users decline to enable push notifications
                    - 8a1. A pop-up tells users notifications help get users the most up-to-date information
                    - 8a2. A button to enable push notifications is now present in the Account page

        4. **[Authenticated Users can comment on extreme weather pings]**:
            - **Description**: Authenticated Users have the ability to leave messages on extreme weather to let others know about important information such as safe houses, supplies or other important knowledge in their vicinity. Users are able to read this information but cannot add their own information.
            - **Primary actor(s)**: Authenticated Users, Users 
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. Authenticated User clicks on the extreme weather event
                2. Authenticated User inputs text message in comment box
                3. User clicks on "Add Comment" button
                4. Comment is added to the extreme weather event ping

            - **Failure scenario(s)**:
                 - 2a. User did not input a valid text 
                    - 2a1. An error will appear next to the text box saying "Input text was not valid, please enter a valid message"
                - 4a. The comment does not reach the server
                    - 4a1. An error will appear next to the text box saying "Message could not reach server, please try again later"
        
        5. **[Users can enable "predictive weather" which shows where the weather event is likely to go]**:
            - **Description**: Users can check a box on the map that allows them to see future movement of the exreme weather event they are currently on. This works for Wildfire Spreading, Tornado direction, and Hurricane direction.
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. User clicks on "Enable Predictive Weather" button
                2. The Map adds a new overlay on top of the current layer without removing the current layer.

            - **Failure scenario(s)**:

        6. **[Admins can remove comments]**:
            - **Description**: Admins have the capacity to remove messages from the list of messages on any given extreme weather event if they deem them 
            - **Main success scenario**:
                1. Admin clicks on extreme weather event ping
                2. Admin can scroll through comments
                3. Admin can click on a comment
                4. A prompt asking "Do you wish to delete this comment" will appear

<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **[Notification Speed]**
    - **Description**: Users must receive notifications within 10 seconds of the information being publicly available.
    - **Justification**: When dealing with a natural disaster, it is important that users have access to the information as soon as possible to ensure maximum safety.
2. **[User Privacy]**
    - **Description**: No User's account information, other than nickname, will ever be accessible to any other User
    - **Justification**: Users have a right to not disclose private information such as email, name, etc. If users choose to set a nickname, only this will be displayed to other Users on the application
