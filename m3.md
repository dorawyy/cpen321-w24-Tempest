          2. Users choose to authenticate with either Facebook or Google
          3. Users login with the respective service
          4. Users are redirected to the account page where they can enter a nickname for anonymity
          5. These users are now Authenticated Users
        - **Failure scenario(s)**:
          - 3a. The respective service returns a failed log in attempt
            - 3a1. The system catches the error
            - 3a2. The frontend shows a pop up telling the user the login failed

### **3.5. Non-Functional Requirements**

<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **[Notification Speed]**
   - **Description**: Users must receive notifications within one minute of the information being available.
   - **Justification**: When dealing with a natural disaster, it is important that users have access to the information as soon as possible to ensure maximum safety. [performance]
2. **[User Privacy]**
   - **Description**: No User's account information, other than nickname, will ever be accessible to any other User
   - **Justification**: Users have a right to not disclose private information such as email, name, etc. If users choose to set a nickname, only this will be displayed to other Users on the application [security]
3. **[Ease of Use]**
   - **Description**: A user must click a maximum of one time to view all information about a disaster
   - **Justification**: Users should be able to access information about a potential threat as quickly an easily as possible. Additionally, less clicks to get necessary information makes the app easier to interface with. [usability]

## 4. Designs Specification

### **4.1. Main Components**

1. **Authentication**

   - **Purpose**: The authentication component authenticates a user with their Google or Facebook accounts allowing them to become an “Authenticated User” actor in the app.
   - **Rationale**: This component in the application is used to create an identity for a user allowing them interact with social features and receive personalized integration
   - **Interfaces**:
     1. UserSession exchangeAuthorizationCode(String authorizationCode, String redirectUri);
        - **Purpose**: Exchanges the provided authorization code for access and ID tokens creating a user session
     2. boolean validateIdToken(String idToken);
        - **Purpose**: Validate the IdToken of the user
     3. String refreshAccessToken(String refreshToken);
        - **Purpose**: Refresh the access token
     4. void logoutUser(String userId);
        - **Purpose**: Logout a user using the userId

2. **Map**

   - **Purpose**: The map component displays extreme weather conditions globally where users can view, comment, and learn about resources on individual weather disasters
   - **Rationale**: This component is necessary to provide a visual interface for users to access accessible weather information. A map-based UI is more engaging and intuitive for users.
   - **Interfaces**:
     1. List<WeatherEvent> getExtremeWeatherEvents(Double latitude, Double longitude);
        - **Purpose**: Retrieves a list of extreme weather events based on location
     2. List<WeatherEvent> getMapExtremeWeatherEvents();
        - **Purpose**: Get all global extreme weather events to display on the map
     3. WeatherEventDetails getEventDetails(String eventId);
        - **Purpose**: Get individual event information from the database such as comments

3. **Comment**

   - **Purpose**: The comment component interact closely with the map component to allow comments to populate on the map and provide functionality to make and remove remarks.
   - **Rationale**: This component is necessary to provide users and admins with the ability to manage their own and all user's comments, respectively. By decoupling this from the Map component, it is easier to debug and manage commnets with a separate component
   - **Interfaces**:
     1. void postComment(String eventId, String userId, String comment);
        - **Purpose**: Post comment from a user on specific event
     2. List<Comment> getEventComments(String eventId);
        - **Purpose**: List specific comments of an event
     3. void removeEventComments(List<UUID> commentId);
        - **Purpose**: Remove all or an individual event commnets

4. **Weather**
   - **Purpose**: Backend component to update the weather database with predictive and AI weather capabilities. The component will call the weather API endpoint periodically retrieving the data so every user sees the same weather information. The component will also notify users of local extreme weather conditions through their communication method of choice
   - **Rationale**: The weather component is used to act as a central consolidation of weather information rather than having the frontend call the API for every user. This mitigates the number of API calls while creating a source of truth for weather information for all users. This gives flexibility of scalability and rate limiting the number of API calls.
   - **Interfaces**:
     1. void fitModel (Weather weatherInformation):
        - **Purpose**: Leverage the existing model and training data to fit the current weather predicting where the wildfire will be
     2. void updateWeatherDB (Weather weatherInformation):
        - **Purpose**: Update the Weather DB with the most recent weather information
     3. void notifyUser (String eventId, String userId):
        - **Purpose**: Notify a user with a specific event
     4. List<Users> checkLocalUsers (String eventId):
        - **Purpose**: Return a list of Users that is affect by the specified event

### **4.2. Databases**

   ![Dependency Diagram](documentation/images/Notif_sequence.jpg)

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**

1. [**[Notification Speed]**](#nfr1)
   - **Validation**: We plan to use an event-driven architecture, where new incoming data will trigger a notification system. Additionally, we plan to scale the size and number of our servers to match demand.
2. [**[User Privacy]**](#nfr1)
   - **Validation**: No information except for the User's nickname will ever be exposed to anyone other than the user. No other Users will be able to view or access this information at any time.
3. [**[Ease of Use]**](#nfr1)
   - **Validation**: The app will open to the map, and from there any map ping can be clicked and all relevant information will be displayed. There will be no need to sign in or click anywhere else in order to view data on an extreme weather event.

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**

**Wildfire path prediction**

- **Description**: Based on current wildfire data and location, we will attempt to compute the path of the wildfire data in the future.
- **Why complex?**: It's complex because this will involve highly advanced algorithms to predict fire line trajectory based on metadata (like wind direction, speed, etc.). It may also involve training a model to enhance prediction.
- **Design**:
  - **Input**: Current fire location, wind direction and speed
  - **Output**: Predicted direction of disaster
  - **Main computational logic (Pseudo Code)**: 
  ```
  for number_of_predictions:
      predicted_path <- wind_speed[fire_location] + wind_intensity[fire_location]
  ```
  This is a simple example of pseudo-code, but this algorithm will have to take in many other factors. This includes the shrubbery surrounding the area of the wildfire, changes in altitude and slopes, current temperature and humidity, regional firefighting resources, and more. We also plan to train and use an artifical intelligence model to more accurately predict disaster pathing.
