# M3 - Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History

- **February 24th, 2025: Replaced AI predictive pathing feature**: Replaced with a "danger score"  for "AI predicitive weather" for complex algorithm. This goal is more reasonable for the scope of this course. The main use of this app is to let people know when they are in danger; hence an algorithm that tells them in how much danger they are in is more useful than predictive weather that may be incorrect.

- **February 24th, 2025: Added custom markers**: Users can now add custom markers for safehouses, resource points, and dangers. This is an extra interaction for users that is useful to share important information amidst dangerous ennvironmental factors. It allows users to share information that may be more important than a simple comment on a weather marker.

- **x___x, 2025: Added Save Locations Use Case**: Users can save important locations for easy tracking and notifications. This use case is for users that may have important locations they would like to be able to be able to receive updates on, for example a second house.

- **February 26th, 2025: Added Google Sign-In and Authnetication**: Users are now redirected to a sign-in page if they are not signed in. After users sign in, they are redirected to a profile page where they can update information about their profile.

- **March 2nd, 2025: Added Front-End Notification Functionality**: Users can now enable notifications and notifications can be received and displayed.

- **March 4th, 2025: Added Back-End Notification and User Functionality**: Updated the POST /user endpoint to match new notification functionality, as well as not duplicate users by viewing user_id. Notification system is also in place to be sent, sending a test notification to users when they save their profile.

## 2. Project Description

**Tempest** is a reimagined weather and emergency preparedness application designed to prioritize critical information about natural disasters, such as wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events. The app delivers **real-time updates** and **localized alerts**, empowering users to stay informed and prepared during emergencies.

Tempest goes beyond traditional weather apps by fostering a **proactive and collaborative community**. Users can:

- **Comment on markers** to share vital information, such as safe routes, resource availability, or dangers in their area.
- **Add custom markers** to the map, highlighting safehouses, resource points, or hazards, creating a crowdsourced network of real-time, community-driven data.
- **View danger scores** for weather events, calculated based on their proximity and severity, helping users make informed decisions quickly.

By combining **real-time weather data** with **community-driven insights**, Tempest serves as a **central hub** for users to gather and share critical information during stressful and unpredictable environmental conditions. Whether preparing for an impending disaster or navigating its aftermath, Tempest ensures users are equipped with the tools and knowledge they need to stay safe and connected.

      ![Dependency Diagram](documentation/images/enable_notifications_sequence.png)

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Design**

1. [**[Accessibility Compliance]**](#nfr1)
   - **Implementation Plans**: The app will be designed to work well for everyone, including people with disabilities. This means making sure the app works with screen readers, using colors that are easy to see, and allowing navigation using just a keyboard. We’ll also use tools to check that the app meets accessibility standards during development.
   - **Testing Approach**: 
      - Use automated testing tools like Lighthouse and Axe to scan the app for accessibility issues (e.g., color contrast, missing ARIA labels).
      - Conduct manual testing with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to ensure all features are accessible.
      
2. [**[User Privacy]**](#nfr1)
   - **Implementation Plans**:The app will protect user data by encrypting it both when it’s stored and when it’s sent over the internet. We’ll also follow privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, giving users control over their data (e.g., letting them delete their information if they want). Regular checks will be done to make sure the app stays secure.
   - **Testing Approach**: 
      - Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in data storage and transmission.
      - Verify encryption implementation by inspecting data at rest (e.g., database encryption) and in transit (e.g., HTTPS).
      - Perform compliance audits to ensure GDPR and CCPA requirements are met, such as providing users with data deletion options.

3. [**[Ease of Use]**](#nfr1)
   - **Implementation Plans**: The app will handle errors gracefully, showing clear messages when something goes wrong (e.g., “No internet connection. Please check your settings.”). Users will also have options to retry or use the app offline. We’ll test these features with real users to make sure they’re easy to understand and use.
   - **Testing Approach**: 
      - Simulate network failures and server downtime to test error messages and recovery options.
      - Use A/B testing to refine error messages and ensure they are clear and actionable.



### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**

**Danger Score Algorithm**

- **Description**: The goal of the danger score is to provide users with a quick, easy-to-understand metric that tells them whether they are in immediate danger and should take action. It also enables the app to send targeted notifications to users with high danger scores, urging them to seek more information from local authorities.


- **How is it complex?**: Calculating the danger score is complex because it requires:

   - Real-time processing of multiple data sources (e.g., user location, weather event data).
   - Weighting and combining different factors (proximity, severity, event type) into a single, meaningful score.
   - Ensuring the score is accurate, reliable, and actionable for users.

- **Design**:
  - **Input**: 
      1. *Proximity to the event*: How close the user is to the weather event.
      2. *Expected danger of the event*: The severity of the event (e.g., a Category 5 hurricane is more dangerous than a Category 1).
      3. *Type of weather event:* Different events (e.g., wildfires, earthquakes, floods) have different levels of risk and urgency, as well as a proximity factor that changes.

  - **Output**: A danger score out of 100 (double) that indicates the level of risk to the user. The higher the score the more immediate danger the user is in.
  - **Main computational logic (Pseudo Code)**: 
  ```
  function calculate_danger_score(user_location, event):
    proximity = calculate_distance(user_location, event.location)
    severity = event.severity
    event_type_weight = get_event_type_weight(event.type)
    
    danger_score = (proximity * proximity_weight) + 
                   (severity * severity_weight) + 
                   (event_type_weight * type_weight)
    
    return normalize_score(danger_score)
  ```
- **Additional Considerations**:
   The algorithm will be optimized for real-time performance to ensure quick updates as the user’s location or weather conditions change.
   Notifications will be triggered for users with danger scores above a certain threshold (e.g., 7 or higher), prompting them to take immediate action.
